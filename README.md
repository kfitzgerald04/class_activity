I had an issue with refactoring the standard Main.java that comes with starting a new project. My Main.java is technically the City.java, but some reason 
when I changed the project structure to 
reflect that, it seemed to corrupt the other files. I got it to run once, but then my computer crashed. I believe I coded it correctly with the help of completing this
after the exam, but I couldn't get it 100%.
